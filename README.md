Secure Chat

Out biggest difference from other chat systems is that we store messages in the users phone.

Thus, no one else get access to others messages. In order to do that, we planned to use peer-to-peer connection between phones. 

Each person enters  ID -which created randomly after user enters its name- to each other and through server, port will be created between users that want to talk. 
After that, their messages will send through this port and will written in to the local file of the phones. 
Thus, without using cloud or firebase users will be able to send messages to each other. 

~Currently our application creates and stores the local files of the messages, but messages are send through database, after receiver open the application messages are deleting from the database~
